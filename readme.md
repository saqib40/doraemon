# Doraemon
Doraemon is an optimization tool, made to optimize your Github-Actions CI workflows for any JS/TS project.

## Essence of it
- It works as "plug and play" tool with Github-Actions configuration which makes it easier to integrate with any existing projects without any restructuring of your existing code base.
- That ease of use along with minimal setup is what mainly distinguishes this tool from overly complex to use tools such as [Nx](https://github.com/nrwl/nx), [Turborepo](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo), and [Bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel).
